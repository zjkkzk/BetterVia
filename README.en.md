## About Via

**Via** Browser is a lightweight Android application developed by Shanghai Zhiwei Network Technology Co., Ltd., renowned for its speed, simplicity, and security.  

### Simple and Pure
Geek-friendly minimalist design, free from push notifications and distractions  
### Lightning-Fast Search
Millisecond launch times, rapid webpage loading
### Effortless Browsing
Compact footprint, low memory usage, no lag
### Security & Privacy
Sandboxed architecture, minimal permissions, robust privacy protection
### Customisation & Extensibility
Resource detection, practical plugins, tailored to individual needs  

However, **Via** still has some shortcomings, such as incomplete features and occasionally inconvenient user operations. Following Android 4.4.1, **Via** introduced a built-in whitelist. Websites listed here will have restrictions on resource sniffing, ad blocking, and browser script usage. These issues are precisely why this module exists.

#### Resource Sniffer Whitelist
`v.qq.com youku.com iqiyi.com mgtv.com bilibili.com ximalaya.com film.qq.com`
#### Ad Blocking Whitelist
`youku.com iqiyi.com mgtv.com qq.com`
#### Browser Script Whitelist
`v.qq.com film.qq.com`

## Detailed Adaptation

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JiGuroLGC/BetterVia/main/img/icon.png" width = "100" height = "100" alt="LOGO"/>

**Via** ( **mark.via** / **mark.via.gp** )  
*Supports version V6.9.0*  

> This project supports both the Chinese version and the Google version of Via

## Other Issues

### Question One
<font color="red">Why is **BetterVia** not functioning correctly on my device?</font>

**BetterVia** was developed by **AIDE Pro** and **Android IDE**, and has been successfully tested on *Android 10 to 16* systems. It should theoretically be compatible with most users, but please ensure your Android version is neither too low nor too high. If, after confirming these conditions, **BetterVia** still fails to function correctly on your device, it may not yet be compatible with your device model or CPU architecture. Please submit your feedback to us and monitor the **LSPosed** update page or follow the channel updates in the [release channels](#release) for the next version update.  

### Question Two
<font color="red">Why does **BetterVia** offer relatively limited functionality?</font>

As **BetterVia** is in its early development phase, our team can only dedicate weekend hours to coding due to work commitments. We will progressively enrich module features during future development cycles.

### Question Three
<font color="red">Why does a "Security Verification Anomaly" pop-up appear after updating or modifying **BetterVia**? And why does "Module Invalid" appear when opening domain-specific software?</font>

You have triggered **BetterVia**'s integrity verification. To prevent unauthorised modification, we have implemented low-intensity integrity checks, including signature verification and other validations. Should you encounter this verification, you should be aware that you have likely downloaded counterfeit software. If triggered during an update due to unforeseen issues, simply clear all software storage and attempt to reopen the application.
In newer versions, we have introduced a "Security Repair" mode. Grant the module Root or file read permissions, then locate the "Security Repair" option in the main menu and click to remove restrictions.

</a>
</p>

### Question Four
<font color="red">Why might module functionality fail or cause the Scope software to crash when using certain root-free frameworks?</font>

The module theoretically supports root-free frameworks. However, on some device models, the modification patches applied by root-free frameworks may conflict with the runtime environment of **BetterVia** or the Scope software, leading to crashes or malfunction. Should this occur, you may consider switching to an alternative patching method or framework.  

### Question Five
<font color="red">What should I do if I encounter access issues as a user in a restricted region?</font>

No worries. We have prepared alternative download links for you. We guarantee that the software and release versions downloaded via these backup links are identical. Additionally, our repositories are available on open-source platforms such as Gitee. You may proceed to the [release channels](#release) and download from other channels.
